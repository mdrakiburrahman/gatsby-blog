          <h2>Why Data?</h2>
          <p>I've been working with Computers for as long as I can remember.</p>
          <p>
            Since I was 5 years old, I grew up building and fixing computers as
            a hobby. As I learned to code, this hobby developed into a deep,
            self-taught expertise of how computer hardware interacts with the
            hypervisor layer to solve real-life problems. Coupled with the
            practically infinite applications of technology and data, I realized
            the frontier of growth in this field is endless. Applied correctly,
            we have the opportunity here to completely shape the world for the
            better.
          </p>
          <p>
            Plus I get to build a pretty entertaining career out of it too{" "}
            <span role="img" aria-label="Laugh">
              üòÑ
            </span>
            .
          </p>
          <h2>Why make this blog?</h2>
          <p>
            Nothing gives me more joy than taking a seemingly{" "}
            <em>"difficult"</em> concept or problem and breaking it down to form
            a simple, elegant solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            I immensely enjoyed writing a few technical blog posts on LinkedIn,
            before quickly realizing the platform is pretty limiting as far as
            how creative you can get with presenting your content. I briefly
            tried WordPress too, and found the engine to be way too clunky (and
            expensive to host).
          </p>
          <p>
            To follow the pros: I decided to learn the{" "}
            <ExtLink link="https://www.javascript.com/">Javascript</ExtLink>{" "}
            framework - primarily{" "}
            <ExtLink link="https://reactjs.org/">React</ExtLink>, and{" "}
            <ExtLink link="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</ExtLink> - and make
            this blog as a fun side project.
          </p>
          <p>
            So basically, this blog is a channel for me to have some fun, while
            also giving back to the Data community!
